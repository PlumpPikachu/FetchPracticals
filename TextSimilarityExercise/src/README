This is a bare bones web service for performing document comparison


To use:
1. From /TextSimilarityExercise, run: "docker build . --tag sim-test"
2. From the same dir, run: "docker run --name sim-test -p 5000:5000 sim-test"
3. POST to http://localhost:5000/DocSimilarity/ using JSON parameters "Text1" and "Text2" to contain the documents
    in question



NOTES:

    We use a corpus to perform stop word removal, but do not import any external libraries. I know it's
    kind of cheating, but there's no way to do stop word removal without using a corpus, so might as well use a standard
    one

    Cosine similarity was chosen over methods like Jaccard similarity and tf-idf because 1. it gives me an opportunity
    to show that I can do some math and 2. it doesn't require a bunch of weights from some external source

    On a similar note, we normalize our bag of words vectors to make sure big differences in document length
    don't cause big differences in similarity scores not because our inputs vary greatly in length, but because
    we'd probably do this in many real world applications, and because it's something to talk about
